You’re the reason God created the middle finger.
You’re a grey sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake.
You are more disappointing than an unsalted pretzel.
Light travels faster than sound which is why you seemed bright until you spoke.
You're so annoying you make your Happy Meal cry.
You look so pretty. Not at all gross, today.
Has someone told you how pretty you are today? Welp, better luck tomorrow.
Your face is just fine but we’ll have to put a bag over that personality.
You bring everyone so much joy, when you leave the room.
I thought of you today. It reminded me to take out the trash.
You are the human version of period cramps.
If you’re going to be two-faced, at least make one of them pretty.
You are like a cloud. When you disappear it’s a beautiful day.
I love what you’ve done with your hair. How do you get it to come out of your nostrils like that?
You are so full of shit, the toilet’s jealous.
You’re as useful as the "ueue" in "queue".
Mirrors can't talk. Lucky for you they can't laugh either.
Some day you'll go far... and I hope you stay there.
You must have been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen.
I bet your ass is jealous of the amount of shit that comes out of your mouth.
So, a thought crossed your mind? Must have been a long and lonely journey.
If I wanted to kill myself I'd climb your ego and jump to your IQ.
When I see your face there's not a thing I would change... except the direction I was walking in.
When you were born the doctor threw you out the window and the window threw you back.
My phone battery lasts longer than your relationships.
